## About

This project is an arcade-themed reaction game I built while learning JavaScript. The goal is to try and stop a cycling color sequence on the target color provided. It includes 8 rounds, with time intervals between color cycling decreasing between each round. 
It includes a 'smart' and dynamic top 10 high-score leaderboard system using Turso's serverless SQLite.
