## About

This project is an arcade-themed reaction game I built while learning JavaScript. The goal of the game is to try and stop a cycling color sequence on the target color provided. It includes 8 rounds, with time intervals between color cycling decreasing between each round. It also includes a persistent and 'smart' high-score leaderboard system deployed Turso's serverless SQLite.
